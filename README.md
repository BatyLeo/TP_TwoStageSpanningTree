# TP_TwoStageSpanningTree

This [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebook is a programming exercise on mathematical programming methods.

It showcases and compares several well known mathematical programming methods on the same toy problem: the minimum weight stochastic two-stage spanning tree problem.

## Installation
First, you need a Julia installation, version 1.9 or higher.
For this, you can either download it from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/), or install it using the [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) tool.
